# Runs-of-Homozygosity
Genome processing from raw reads through to BAM.

From BAM: Identify ROH with ROHan and process the results.

Filter and summarize ROHan outputs using Linux and then plot in R.

Convert BAM to VCF, combine + genotype VCF, filter VCF, calculate summary stats, convert VCF to PLINK, call ROH in PLINK.
